Your devices screen size be too small to fit the windows on your screen if that is the case ... too bad

This was one of the first major projects I worked on in school. We had to make an application that uses the menu widget from tkinter and I decided to make a choose your own adventure game that uses the menu widget as an inventory. I have no plans on updating this or changing it in any way. However I might make a similar game later.
